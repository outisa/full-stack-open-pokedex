I chose Scala as the coding language for this project. For linting (and refactoring) I would use Scalafix. For testing purposes it would be good to use the ScalaTest as it seems to be versatile. Sbt could be used for building. It is also possible to use maven or gradle for building and then the building process behaves like a typical Java Project.

There are quite many CI alternatives for Jenkins and GitHub Actions, for example, there is CircleCi, Buddy, Shippable, GitLab, Semaphore and Travis CI. 

CircleCI can be used as cloud-based as well as self hosted. Buddy is also one option and can be also used as self-hosted or as cloud-based. One can also use GitLab for version control and CI/CD. GitLab.com is cloud-based and hosted by GitLab but there are also self-hosted subscriptions available . Semaphore is cloud-based for ‘normal’ users, but the enterprise version has also some self-hosted solutions. There is also Shippable CI/CD is specifically for Scala projects and it is hosted SaaS offering as well as a server. Travis CI is also cloud-based but this one has also a self-hosted enterprise version. In this project scenario it is better to use a cloud-based environment, because there is no need to update or maintain the environment in this case. If the developer team  ‘wants’ only to do the basic linting checking and testing stuff, then cloud-based services are normally enough and also a bit lighter to use as self-hosted versions.
